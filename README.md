REST APIs are the most popular and flexible APIs found on the web today. The client sends requests to the server as data. The server uses this client input to start internal functions and returns output data back to the client. Letâ€™s look at REST APIs in more detail below.

# What are REST APIs?

REST stands for Representational State Transfer. REST defines a set of functions like GET, PUT, DELETE, etc. that clients can use to access server data. Clients and servers exchange data using HTTP.

The main feature of REST API is statelessness. 
Statelessness means that servers do not save client data between requests. 
Client requests to the server are similar to URLs you type in your browser to visit a website. 
The response from the server is plain data, without the typical graphical rendering of a web page.
